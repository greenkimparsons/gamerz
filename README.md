# gamerz DESCRIPTION

	GAMERZ creates a community that allows gaming enthusiasts to connect with new players. By giving the users a select amount of games to choose from, the user will be able to find new people to connect with who share the same interests in the same games.

# gamerz USER STORY

	As a gaming enthusiast, I want to be able to use an app that allows me to find new enthusiasts, according to interests, to play with.
    
    Given I am a GamerZ user, when I open GamerZ I will be presented with a log-in and sign up page. When I create my account  I will be presented with a set of gaming consoles to choose from. Once I choose my console I will be presented with a select amount of games that I can choose from and connect with users who play  the same games.

# gamerz CHALLENGES

    Everything was a challenge. We had a lot of errors with our associations and dealing with cyclic dependency error in the beginning. Then we had errors with our event listeners, jQuery, get/fetch/post requests.
